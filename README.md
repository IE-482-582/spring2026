# IE 482/582 Intro to Robotics

Welcome to the Spring 2026 semester. 

---

## Assignment 1

We will use GitHub extensively this semester to share and track code that we write. This assignment should help you get comfortable with GitHub.

### Part 1: Register for a GitHub account with your UB email

You must have a GitHub account with your UB email address (even if you've already created an account using a different email). 
- Visit https://education.github.com/pack

### Part 2: Complete the Following Three Training Exercises
- https://github.com/skills-dev/introduction-to-github
- https://github.com/skills-dev/communicate-using-markdown
- https://github.com/skills-dev/github-pages

This will create 3 "repositories", which the TA will check.

Notes:
- Sometimes it takes a minute or two to prepare each exercise. &nbsp;Refresh the page periodically until the page looks like this:
    <img width="965" height="475" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a648e97-e621-4fb8-952d-8aba527109c4" />

- Make sure your repository visibility is public (so the TA can verify that you've completed the exercise).
- We'll do more of the exercises found at https://learn.github.com/skills later in the semester. 

### How to Submit Your Work:
**You must submit thru UBlearns; I've posted here just for your reference**
- Provide the 3 links to your repositories before Tuesday's class.

## Assignment 2

We will be controlling robots with Python. It is good practice to use "virtual environments" when installing Python packages for various projects.

Because everyone's laptop is a little different, I can't provide a one-size-fits-all guide for this; you'll need to do some searching to find out how best to set things up on your machine.

If you encounter any issues, please post them to https://github.com/IE-482-582/spring2026/issues/1
- Do not email the instructor/TA; post to the issue tracker.
